# Cub Scout Pack Example Dataset (Graphdown)

This repository is a **Graphdown dataset** that demonstrates the structure and organization of a Cub Scout pack.

It includes:

- Type objects in `types/`
- Record objects in `records/` using the canonical parent-based export layout

Notes:
- All contact info is fake/demo data.
- This is meant to be schema-agnostic and editable via the raw Graphdown editor.
